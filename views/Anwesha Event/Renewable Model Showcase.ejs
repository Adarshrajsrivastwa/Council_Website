            <h3>Renewable Model Showcase </h3>
            <p>The Renewable Model Showcase is a hands-on, educational exhibit that
                introduces visitors to various forms of renewable energy.<br/><br/> This exhibit
                features miniature working models that simulate how solar, wind,
                hydropower, biomass, geothermal, and hybrid energy systems function,
                allowing viewers to see and understand renewable energy concepts up
                close. <br/><br/>Each model highlights the operational principles behind these
                technologies, the equipment used, and their real-world applications.<br/><br/>
                Entry fees :- 100/- per team (max. 3 team members)
