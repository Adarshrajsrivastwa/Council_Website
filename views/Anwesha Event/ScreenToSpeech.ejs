            <h3>Screen to Speech</h3>
            <p>
              Screen to speech is fun contest which is a fun way to let student develop skills
              like public speaking, creativity, narration, dialogue and monologue to
              accompany the scene.<br>
              This event tests creativity, storytelling, and improvisational skills, encouraging
              participants to bring scenes to life with their words. Whether humorous,
              dramatic, or poetic, the best narrations will be those that captivate the
              audience and seamlessly fit the visuals.<br>
              Format:<br>
              ✓ Participants will be given a random muted clip.<br>
              ✓ They will have a short preparation time to craft their narration.<br>
              ✓ Live performance of their speech in front of an audience and judges.<br>
              Screen to Speech is your chance to bring those creative thoughts to life!<br>
