            ↳ The baton must be exchanged within the designated exchange zone.<br>
            ↳ The exchange zone length is 20 meters for both the 4x100m and 4x400m relays<br>

            ↳ The baton must be passed within the designated exchange zone.<br>
            ↳ If the baton is exchanged outside this zone, the team faces disqualification.<br>
            ↳ Baton Drop:<br>
            ↳ If a runner drops the baton, they may retrieve it, but the baton must be passed within the
            exchange zone.<br>
            ↳ Dropping the baton outside the exchange zone results in disqualification<br>
           
          </p>
          <h3>Exchange Zone Rules :-</h3>
          <p>↳ Exchange Zone:<br>
            ↳ The exchange zone is 20 meters long for both the 4x100m and 4x400m relays.<br>
            ↳ Runners must pass the baton within this zone, or they risk disqualification.<br>
            ↳ Acceleration Zone (for some events):<br>
            ↳ In the 4x100m relay, runners may accelerate before receiving the baton, as long as they
            remain within the exchange zone<br>
           
          </p>
          <h3>Disqualification Rules :-</h3>
          <p>↳ Baton Handling:<br>

            ↳ Improper Baton Exchange:<br>
            ↳ If the baton is not exchanged correctly within the zone, the team is disqualified.<br>

          <p>↳ Starting Position:<br>
            ↳ The first runner starts from blocks (for sprint relays) or in a standing position (for distance
            relays).<br>

            ↳ Timing:<br>
            ↳ The relay race time is recorded when the final runner crosses the finish line.<br>

          <p>↳ Lane Usage:<br>

            ↳ In the 4x400m relay, runners remain in their lane until the first 100 meters is completed,
            after which they may move to the inner lanes.<br>
            ↳ Hand-Off Positioning:<br>
            ↳ The outgoing runner must position themselves correctly for a smooth baton exchange.<br>
            ↳ The incoming runner must ensure they pass the baton within the designated zone.<br>
           
          </p>
          <h3>Mixed Gender Relays :-</h3>
          <p>↳ In mixed-gender relay races, each team consists of two male and two female runners.<br>
            ↳ The baton exchange follows the same rules as standard relays.<br>

            ↳ Team Selection:<br>
            ↳ Additional rules may apply for team selection and participation in different competitions.<br>
